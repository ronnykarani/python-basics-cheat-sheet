#WHILE LOOPS
#while loops are use to execute a block of code multiple times
#Syntax = while condition:
#if the condition is true the code below that will be repeatedly executed
#when the condition evaluates tofalse it jumps out of the loop
index = 1
while index <= 5:
    print(index)
    index += 1 #increases the index by one on every iteration to avoid an infinite loop
print("Done")

i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print('*' * i)
    i += 1 
print("Done")
#break and continue statements
#break stops the loop from iterating again(ends the loop prematurely)
#continue stops the current loop/iteration and goes to the next one
